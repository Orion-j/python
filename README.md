## In-Scope
A Basic approach to solving problems and familiarizing oneself with the python syntax. <br>
This is a collection of the "A code a Day" of my engineering journey #100DaysOfCode <br>
Which comprises of daily task, some assignment given, and  Data Structures & Algorithm codes. <br>
These are very basic and also beginner-friendly programs.<br>
Don't hesitate to contribute, code-wise, typography etc. Let's make this repo one that is a go-to for any python beginner<br>

### Navigating through the Repo (./..)
