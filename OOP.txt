@OOP is a set of programming principles.
And it deals with objects rather than lone-standing data and lone-standing procedures.
Bundles data with functionality to create objects that interact with one another.

#Classes are used to create objects
#Objects(variables assigned to classes) are made up of Attributes and Methods.
Attribute(variables with the "self".prefix) represent data(features and characteristics)
about the object.
Method(functions inside a class) represents functionalities of the object.

__init__ method; why significant
# where initialise all attributes.
#automatically executed with every new class instance.
#it is reserved name. It has self parameter.
